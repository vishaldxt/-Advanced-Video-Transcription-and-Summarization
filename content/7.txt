foreign [Music] Village there lived a man named leeway he was special because he could do things that seemed like magic he could walk through walls without any trouble and he could even stand in a fire without getting burned people thought he had some secret tricks or powers but the real secret behind leeway's abilities was something called Tao it's like a special way of understanding the world and being in tune with everything around you she learned that you don't always have to use force or cleverness to do amazing things years before leeway had met an old wise person who taught him all about Dao he had discovered that if he could clear his mind and not worry about limits he could do incredible things so one day he walked right through a wall not because he was really strong but because he believed he could do it word spread about leeway's talents and soon many people came to see him they thought he had some secret tricks but actually he had let go of fear and uncertainty he didn't want to show off so he started Living in a simple way but he shared his wisdom with those who were curious to learn as time went by leeway became known for being calm and simple he faced challenges peacefully like a leaf floating on water problems didn't bother him because he understood that life has its ups and downs you see in life in your life the most amazing power comes from understanding Simplicity and staying connected with the world look maybe you won't be able to run through a brick wall but who knows the moral of the story is you don't need to be afraid of any challenge in life if you learn to be like leeway be gentle and be wise like a soft Breeze that brings peace and wisdom to everyone around you stories thank you so much for watching and stay blessed
