foreign [Music] when you died a car accident not spectacular but fatal you didn't feel any pain the paramedics did their best to save you but unsuccessfully your body was completely shattered it's better this way believe me and then you met me what happened where am I [Music] you died I realized why should I sugarcoat it there was a truck it's skidded yes I'm dead but don't worry everyone dies eventually you looked around there was nothing just you and me is this the afterlife something like that are you God yes I am God what about my children my wife will they be okay that's how I like it I said you just died and your greatest concern is for your family that's how it should be you looked at me with fascination I didn't look like God to you I just looked like a man or a woman a little intimidating don't worry I said they will be fine in the memories of your children you will be perfect forever they were too young to be embarrassed by you your wife will mourn you externally but secretly she will feel relieved if it comforts you will have great guilt because your marriage was already over oh and now do I go to heaven or hell or something neither you will be reborn ah so the Hindus were right all religions are right in their own way come let's take a walk you walked beside me and we talked through nothingness where are we going nowhere it's just nice to walk and talk while we can what's the point of it all if I'm going to be reborn I start from scratch right as a baby yes but you carry all the knowledge and experiences of your past lives within you you just don't remember them at the moment I stopped and held you by the shoulder your soul is wonderful unimaginably beautiful and enormously vast the human mind can only grasp a fraction of it it's like when you put your hand in water to see if it's warm or cold you've only put in a small part of yourself and yet you've gained all the experiences that part has had you have been a human for the past 48 years but you haven't expanded enough yet to feel the immense consciousness if we were here long enough you would eventually remember everything but it's pointless between lives how many times have I been reincarnated then oh Luts lots and lots and into lots of different lives this time you'll be a peasant girl in China around 540 BC wait what you're sending me back in time in a way yes but the concept of time as you know it only exists in your universe where I come from everything is different where you come from too naturally I come from somewhere and there are others like me now you want to know what it's like there but honestly you wouldn't understand you said disappointedly but wait if I'm reincarnated at different times I could have already met myself yes you have done so many times since in both lives you only have your own life experience you didn't even notice but why what's the point I looked into your eyes the meaning of life the reason for this universe is for you to evolve you mean Humanity should evolve no just you I created all this universe for you with each new life you mature and become wiser only you it's just you you stared at me in this belief but all the people on Earth they're all incarnations of you I am all of them now you get it I am every human who has ever lived or will ever live yes Abram Lincoln John F Kennedy I am Hitler you said horrified and the millions he killed I am Jesus and you are all his followers you felt silent everything you've ever done to anyone you've done to yourself Every Good Deed you've done was for yourself every beautiful and every sad moment that any human has ever experienced you have experienced or will experience you thought for a long time why what's the point of all this because one day you will be like me well that's you you belong to us you are my child wow you said in disbelief I am a god not yet you are a fetus you will wake up when you have been every human whoever was and then you will be mature enough to be born [Music] so the whole universe is just an egg I answered and now it's time for your next life and I sent you on your way [Music]
