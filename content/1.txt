[Music] [Applause] the ultimate fighting championship is the biggest mixed martial arts organization in the world it averages more than 40 events per year and puts on hundreds of fights featuring some of the best combat athletes in the world its three-letter acronym ufc is synonymous with fighting and conjures up an excitement that is unique to combat sports it is home to world champions with legacies to their name and has seen the rise to fame and fall from grace of countless athletes it is both a sport and a form of entertainment which has turned ordinary people into millionaires and celebrities even extending its reach into the ranks of hollywood 2020 proved to be the most successful year in the company's 29 year history seeing its market value rise to an estimated record high of 10 billion dollars to what does the ufc owe its success how did it manage to turn what some people used to dismissively call human [ __ ] fighting into a respected sport in a multi-billion dollar industry what are the origins of this brutal spectacle and who are the people involved in this evolution the earliest known sport most similar to modern mixed martial arts is the ancient greek pancration a form of unarmed hands-to-hand fighting predominantly based on wrestling and boxing arising sometime between the 20th and 7th century bc it was both a sport as well as a form of military training athletes would fight naked using a wide variety of striking and grappling techniques in bouts which typically had no rounds no weight classes and barely any rules other than prohibiting eye gauging and biting although both of these were permitted in sparta contests would end when one fighter was either incapacitated or signaled to submission though it was not uncommon for men to die kicks and punches were allowed and athletes would regularly get knocked out it is said however that the majority of fights would end in grappling exchanges with one of the athletes submitting to his opponent pancration events were generally held in tournament format on both regional and national levels and were even introduced into the greek olympic games in 648 bc various legends surround the origins of the sport as well as some of its most successful competitors many of whom rose to fame and became heroes thanks to their accomplishments and exploits both in the arena and on the battlefield so successful and effective was this form of combat that the romans adopted it into their military training as well as including it in their games at the coliseum with the decline of ancient greece and rome however the sport's popularity slowly began to dwindle until it was finally outlawed along with many other pagan rituals in 393 a.d what remains are statues and monuments depicting some of the violence that took place as well as the stories surrounding it although there are many similarities between pancration and modern mixed martial arts there is a great gap between the disappearance of the former and the evolution of the latter the story of how the ufc was created and mixed martial arts became the sport it is today is a different one mitsuyo maeda also known as konde koma was a japanese judo champion who was born in japan in 1878 a student of kanojigoro the very founder of judo maeda was a true martial artist ever improving and evolving as well as never backing down from a challenge he had been a star pupil at the infamous and prestigious kodokan judo institute in tokyo and as such was selected to travel the world in order to represent judo as well as teach it maeda's travels led him to the us great britain as well as other countries in central and south america along the way he trained with taught and fought athletes from different disciplines such as boxers and wrestlers almost all of whom had a height and size advantage over the rather unassuming looking japanese he grew accustomed to being the smaller man and over time added techniques from different sports particularly western wrestling into his arsenal on the whole maeda subscribed to a less sport and more combat-oriented school of judo one more closely resembling the roots of the art jujitsu jujitsu originally evolved in the feudal societies of 16th and 17th century japan samurai warriors roaming the lands in service of their masters or the highest bidder developed techniques that were suitable for fighting armed and armored opponents those included strikes and kicks but predominantly relied on grappling techniques aimed at disarming throwing and pinning an opponent in an increasingly modernizing and industrialized japan however the art of jiu jitsu grew both obsolete and frowned upon as did the samurai who had developed it and their way of life still there were those that understood the values of martial arts as an educational tool even in peace times and as a way to live a healthier and better life allowing one to reach his or her full potential leading the way was member of the japanese ministry of culture and martial arts kanojigoro omitting some of the more dangerous and brutal techniques from jujitsu emphasizing throwing techniques and minimizing ground fighting jigoro effectively created the sport of judo in an effort to promote and spread the art he sent out some of his more promising students to travel the world so they could teach judo and prove its merit one of these students was the conda coma mitsuyo maida soon after arriving in brazil maeda befriended a businessman called gastal gracie in 1917 and began teaching the art of jiu jitsu to his son carlos thus would gradually begin a new era of martial arts the graciera carlos gracie along with his brothers most notably helio gracie trained taught and revolutionized the sport of judo or as they knew it jujitsu much like mitsuyo maeda before them they incorporated techniques into their training that could be used not only in sports competitions but in actual fights against opponents of any background no matter the rule set they put a great emphasis on ground fighting as well as using leverage to their advantage which allowed them to beat bigger and stronger opponents the gracies believed that they were creating a style of jiu-jitsu that was superior to all other martial arts gracie jiu-jitsu they even went so far as to issue a challenge to any practitioner of any martial art to put the effectiveness of their fighting style to the test in fights with minimal rules this would become known as the gracie challenge and the no holds barred fights they organized would eventually be known as valitudo which is portuguese for everything goes fighting became something of a family trait for the gracies who through their many challenges and contests amassed a small following as well as igniting several rivalries with other local martial arts schools rio de janeiro was the capital of this newfound martial arts craze which slowly but surely was beginning to make its way out of the underground and into the mainstream this new wave of jujitsu however was about more than just fighting it was seen as a way of life a tool meant to improve a person's character and allow them to realize their full potential on and off the mats perhaps because of where jujitsu had originally started in brazil it was also closely entwined with beach and surfer culture it should come to no surprise then that upon moving to america rory and gracie son of helio gracie found a new home in california he opened his own school and continued his family's work alongside his younger brother roycey recruiting new students challenging local martial artists and slowly but surely making his mark in the american martial arts scene in 1993 along with several business partners investors as well as some of his students roryon created a televised eight-man tournament which pitted martial artists from different backgrounds against one another with the aim of finding out which martial art was the best much a continuation of the gracie challenge with practically no rules time limits or judges scores the fights could only be won through knockout submission or a fighter's corner throwing in the towel fights were held in the now famous octagon-shaped cage with wired fencing and were supposed to be as raw and violent as possible in order to show the audience the true nature of fighting the tournament was called the ultimate fighting championship the younger and physically smaller roycey was chosen to represent the gracie family in this televised event as it would send a stronger message and underscore the effectiveness of gracie jiu jitsu if a smaller man were to win the tournament which he did this set the stage for a series of sequels some of which were also won by roycey gradually a broader spectrum of more and more athletically accomplished competitors looking to prove themselves was drawn to this ultimate challenge as well as the increasing prize money minor rules were implemented meant to improve fighter safety as well as make the tournaments more appealing to a wider audience with this greater exposure however came heavy criticism which promptly drew stricter government regulation this led to several u.s states banning so-called no-holds-barred events in 1997. in response the ufc began working more closely with state athletic commissions towards the implementation of unified rules for mixed martial arts the introduction of weight divisions timed rounds mandatory gloves as well as the prohibition of several techniques deemed too dangerous where among the many changes made to ensure the gradual transition of mma from a violent spectacle to a serious sport in 2000 casino executives frank and lorenzo fertitta bought the ufc for 2 million dollars and instated childhood friend and fight promoter and manager dana white as the company's president this ushered in a new era for the ufc which slowly but surely saw it overcome its precarious financial situation as well as establish itself in the public eye over the next few years the company kept growing its brand visiting new countries and maintaining its place as the world's premier mma organization through the acquisition of smaller international organizations such as pride m1 and the wec as well as through innovations such as the addition of several women's weight classes in 2016 the ufc was sold for an astonishing 4 billion dollars marking the largest sale of a franchise in professional sports history throughout these ups and downs the sport itself has seen a steady evolution as one generation of fighters has been replaced by another each starting to train at a younger age athletes of increasingly higher calibers who otherwise might have chosen different sports have decided to pursue mma as a career over the years this has led to a gradual shift in preferred fighting styles and a better understanding of what works inside the octagon and what doesn't traditional martial arts such as karate or taekwondo which had been ridiculed in the advent of what people were beginning to consider real fighting soar resurgence as students of these arts learned ways to implement their so-called outdated techniques in a real fight trend after trend swept through the mma world with seemingly indefensible techniques being discovered only to become somewhat obsolete and be replaced with a new trend shortly after the rise of social media and streaming services has led to even greater exposure of mma in popular culture and allowed for a growing acceptance as well as an understanding and appreciation of martial arts within the general public combined with aggressive marketing and expansion on the ufc's part this has made mma one of the fastest growing sports in the world in time this growth is bound to slow the evolution of the sport itself the techniques and the understanding of what is possible inside the octagon however are growing faster than ever this was there to explain with the history of the ufc thank you so much for watching and stay blessed [Music]
